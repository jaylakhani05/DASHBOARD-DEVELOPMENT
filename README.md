In this task, Data Visualization, required me to create meaningful visual representations of data to convey insights more effectively. Using matplotlib and seaborn, I built various charts such as bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, and line graphs. These visualizations helped in identifying trends, comparisons, and outliers. For instance, I used pie charts to show proportional data, bar charts to compare categorical variables, and correlation heatmaps to highlight strong linear relationships between numeric variables. This task emphasized the power of visual storytelling and demonstrated how complex data can be made accessible and engaging through simple visuals.
